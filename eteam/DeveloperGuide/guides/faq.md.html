      <h2 id="do-i-have-to-use-npm">Do I have to use npm?</h2>
      <p>
        We used npm in development, so we strongly recommend you to use it also.
        Anyway, <code>yarn</code> is great alternative and should work just
        fine.

        Why is there a mess in localization system?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We developed the project without thinking about translation, so we had
        to add it in the middle of the development. There is no need to worry
        because all non-deprecated projects uses our latest Localization system
        which is well described in this documentation and is shared across all
        latest projects.
