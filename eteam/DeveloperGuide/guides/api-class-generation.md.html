      <p>
        In our frontend application, we do not define API routes manually, we
        use swagger documentation on our API to generate it automatically.<br />
        All you need to do is to run <code>npm run gen:api</code> inside
        frontend application, and it will generate all methods into
        <code>src/services/API.ts</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now all you need to do in order to execute some API request is to run
        <code>API.loginCompany()</code> inside <code>.ts</code> the file. All
        methods from API can be found under this <code>API</code> class and the
        class is fully typed. All methods return promises so don’t forget to
        <code>await</code> the response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some projects have <code>Utils.ts</code> a file that includes wrappers
        to communicate with the API. If the project has utils file, we strongly
        recommend you to use it. Check out what methods are there in utils of
        specific project and search project for usages. It should not be hard at
        all to find out how to use them, and they usually add visualization to
        the application while the query is being executed, so you won’t have to
        worry about error handling, showing loading animation and much more.
