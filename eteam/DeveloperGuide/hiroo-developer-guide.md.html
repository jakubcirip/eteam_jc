      <p>
        Hiroo is a web application that serves as a tool for a HR-specialilst.
        Let’s say you found 100 candidates that would fit into a company so you
        need to schedule a call (interview) with every single one of them
        one-on-one. This would take too much time and effort. HR-specialist come
        to Hiroo, creates an interview (or pick template) and use Hiroo as
        pre-selection tool. This way, HR specialist spend way less time just
        watching the results and AI can show some information to speed up the
        process even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiroo can also be used as a pre-selection tool for non-stop interview.
        For example, some companies are willing to hire a candidate whenever if
        he is good enough. Using Hiroo, HR specialist can prepare an interview
        (or pick a template) to check language or communication skills and only
        invite candidates to a personal interview if their score was at least
        50%.

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hiroo consists of multiple projects and each of them may have its own
        specific documentation. If a project has a specific documentation, you
        can find it in <code>projects/*.md.html</code> file.

      <h2 id="frontend-projects">Frontend projects</h2>
      <h3 id="angularglobal">AngularGlobal</h3>
      <p>
        Angular (frontend) project based on ThemeForest bootstrap theme
        originally used as both presentation and registration web. The New
        presentation web was created in a separate project so right now,
        AngularGlobal serves as a web to register and login new company. This
        project is served on <code>register.hiroo.eu</code>.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h3 id="angularclient">AngularClient</h3>
      <p>
        Angular (frontend) project based on ThemeForest bootstrap theme that
        contains presentation web focused on corporates and themed around
        COVID-19. This web was served on <code>hiroo.eu</code> but is now not
        used anywhere because Hiroo attempts to focus on small and medium-sized
        companies instead of corporates. Instead of updating information, we
        created a new project <a href="#AngularCheckli">AngularCheckli</a> to
        replace this one due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No light-theme support</li>
        <li>Weak i18n support (not supporting our latest ecosystem)</li>
        <li>
          Design not fitting for smaller companies (they like simple
          minimalistic web with decent animations)
        </li>
        <li>Information not fitting for small companies</li>
      </ul>

        Angular (frontend) project based on Tailwild using TailwindUI components
        that contains new presentation web (used right now) focused on small and
        medium-sized companies. This web is served on <code>hiroo.eu</code>.

      <p>
        Angular (frontend) project based on ThemeForest bootstrap theme that
        contains interface for candidate. Originally, there was
        <code>AngularInterview</code> project, but it has been refactored and
        removed due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>terrible code</li>
        <li>terrible design</li>
        <li>too many bugs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project is served on <code>interview.hiroo.eu</code>.</p>
      <h3 id="angularcompany">AngularCompany</h3>
      <p>
        Angular (frontend) project based on ThemeForest bootstrap theme that
        contains interface for logged in company and hr.
        <strong
          >This is the biggest frontend application of the whole Hiroo
          project.</strong
        >
        This project is served on <code>{company}.hiroo.eu</code> where
        <code>{company}</code> is company domain provided when registering
        company. You cannot see this project unless you created company on
        <code>register.hiroo.eu</code>. When registering a company, there is the
        option to enter a domain name which has slug format. After finishing a
        registration and confirming company email address, you can visit your
        company Hiroo subdomain. For example, if my company is
        <code>T-Systems</code> and I used <code>t-systems</code> as a domain
        name, I can visit my company subdomain on
        <code>t-systems.hiroo.eu</code>. This is the website where everything is
        done (by both company and hr).
      </p>
      <h3 id="angularplatform">AngularPlatform</h3>
      <p>
        Angular (frontend) project based on Tailwind using TailwindUI components
        that is supposed to replace <code>AngularCompany</code> but is currently
        not finished (as of early 2021). We decided to recode this project due
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bad UI/UX (tables everywhere)</li>
        <li>Bad dark/light theme support</li>
        <li>Some responsivity problems</li>
        <li>No i18n support</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project is in development but once it’s ready, it will replace
        AngularProject, so it will be served on
        <code>{company}.hiroo.eu</code> as explained in
        <a href="#AngularCompany">AngularCompany</a> section
      </p>

      <h3 id="server">Server</h3>
      <p>
        This folder contains Node.JS project that serve as an API for the whole
        project. This project uses the latest localization system and can be
        found on <code>api.hiroo.eu</code>.<br />

        <a href="projects/server.md.html">Server Guide</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="swaggergui">SwaggerGUI</h3>
      <p>
        Project created to speed up the development of the API server. This
        folder includes Angular projects that provides GUI interface (on
        website) to define new routes. You simply enter basic information about
        the new route (route itself, what protection you need, what input you
        get, what output you give) and press <code>copy</code> button. This
        copies CLI script into your clipboard so you can just paste it into CLI
        inside <code>Server</code> folder and it will generate all
        documentation, guards, controllers and service wrapper for you. You just
        enter the service folder, find the generated method at top of the file
        and implement logic. Everything is generated and strictly typed, so you
        cannot send an incorrect response by mistake. You simply run
        <code>npm run serve</code> to start the website and it automatically
        connects to your API server on port <code>3000</code>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="email-listener">Email-Listener</h3>
      <p>
        This folder includes NodeJS project that does everything around mails.
        It uses MySQL connection to mail database that is filled by API server
        and whenever it sees new request, it sends the email. This email
        listener support multiple connections so it not only support emails from
        <code>support@hiroo.eu</code>, but also can send emails from specific
        division emails, for example
        <code>tsystems.kosice@hiroo.eu</code>.<br />
        Also, this server listens for new emails on division emails so it can
        automatically register candidate into an interview.
      </p>
      <h3 id="interview-server">Interview-Server</h3>
      <p>
        Simple NodeJS script to provide interview functionality. It connects to
        MySQL database to see status of all interviews. Whenever the API changes
        some status, this server catches it and schedule the function to run
        specific actions in specific times. For example, it starts an interview
        (mark as started in database, schedule emails for candidates), remind
        candidates that the interview is about to finish and finally, mark the
        interview as finished. Long story short, this is simple script to manage
        scheduled actions. This script does not analyse interview results, the
        analysis function is inside <code>Server</code> the API folder.
      </p>
      <h3 id="interviewttsgenerator">InterviewTTSGenerator</h3>
      <p>
        Simple NodeJS script that takes input generated from
        AngularInterviewRefactor projects, parses it to get texts used by emoji
        and send it to Google API to generate text to speech (mp3). These MP3
        files are then moved to AngularInterviewRefactor and used by the
        website. You only need to use this project if you change some static
        text said by emoji on AngularInterviewRefactor, you create new language
        or add new message said by emoji. To identify what messages are used by
        emoji in AngularInterviewRefactor, you can simply look into
        <code>EmojiMp3Guard</code> class
        (<code>app/src/emoji-mp3.guard.ts</code>)
      </p>
      <h3 id="emoji-convert">Emoji-Convert</h3>
      <p>
        Small NodeJS script that converted purchased assets (mp4 video) of emoji
        animations into PNG assets. These assets were put into Server folder and
        are being used in AngularInterviewRefactor project. You won’t need to
        touch this script unless you want to modify emoji animations or add a
        new one.
      </p>
      <h3 id="lang-convert">Lang-Convert</h3>
      <p>
        This folder contains NodeJS script that was used by our deprecated
        language system to generate Google spreadsheet tables from translation
        files, so the translator can easily see the content. This script is no
        longer being used and was replaced by Localazy in our new localization
        system.
      </p>
      <h3 id="postleaf">postleaf</h3>
      <p>
        Postleaf folder contains clone of the <code>postleaf</code> open-source
        project used for blog website that can be found on
        <code>blog.hiroo.eu</code>. This is pure clone with no changes and using
        their pre-defined theme. Be aware, this project may need Node V7, nor
        Node V12 depending on libraries updates. Please use NodeVersionManager
        to try both V7 and V12 when doing <code>npm install</code>. If one
        throws an error, please try the other one. So far, it always worked on
        V7.
