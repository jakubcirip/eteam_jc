      <p>
        This project is created using Angular framework. Feel free to look at
        <a href="https://angular.io/docs">Angular documentation</a> to learn
        more. This is a small Angular app and has nothing special to it other
        than API class generation system and i18n system described below.
        Anyway, we strongly recommend to use <code>components</code> folder for
        components and <code>pages</code> folder for components that are using
        in Angular routing files to prevent mess in the project if it grows. To
        learn basics about this project, go to
        <a href="../guides/hiroo-developer.guide.md.html">Developer guide</a>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses Angular 11, has the latest localization support and
        uses Tailwind 2 with it’s
        <a href="https://tailwindui.com/components">TailwundUI</a> components.
      </p>
      <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
      <p>
        After cloning repository from GitHub, you enter the AngularCheckli
        project by typing
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ cd AngularCheckli
</code></pre>
      <p>To install all dependencies you will need for development, you run</p>
      <pre><code>$ npm i
</code></pre>
      <p>
        We recommend you to serve this application on port
        <code>4203</code> because other ports may be used by different projects.
        To serve an application for development, you run
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ npm run dev:en
</code></pre>
      <p>
        After starting the development server, you can visit
        <code>http://localhost:4203/</code> to see the application. All changes
        in <code>src</code> the folder will force the development server to
        recompile and refresh the website automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project uses our API generation system. You can find more
        information in
        <a href="../guides/api-class-generation.md.html"
          >API class generation</a
        >
        document.
      </p>
      <h2 id="localization">Localization</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses the latest localization system. To find a detail
        description about our localization system, please visit
        <a href="../guides/localization.md.html">Localization</a> document.
      </p>
      <h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
      <p>To deploy the application, you run</p>
      <pre><code>$ npm run build
</code></pre>
      <p>
        This will compile the website and create <code>dist/twt</code> a folder.
        You copy content of this folder into the static server directory on your
        server. Make sure to configure your static server to always return
        <code>index.md.html</code> in case of <code>404 error</code>. Here is an
        example of such a configuration in <code>nginx</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name hiroo.eu;
    root /var/www/hiroo.eu;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.md.html =404;
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        (this configuration does not include https. You can use
        <code>certbot</code> to update this config file and support https)
