      <h1 id="server">Server</h1>
      <p>
        Please use Node v12 in this project. If this version does not work, try
        to update to the latest stable version. You know if a specific version
        works by trying to do <code>npm install</code> on that version. If it
        throws errors, it does not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before starting the server, please make sure you have the correct
        configuration in <code>.env</code> file. If you do not have any, please
        refer to <code>.env.example</code> to create one. Also, please make sure
        you have ran migration and seeds to create database schema and sample
        data by running <code>npm run db</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project requires connection to multiple services, so please make
        sure they are up and running before starting the API. The list of
        dependencies is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email server (SMTP server information)</li>
        <li>
          PHP server with IČO verified (not being used right now, not required)
        </li>
        <li>
          path to google credentials json (used by text to speech, speech to
          text)
        </li>
        <li>
          HostCreators tokens (used to dynamically create email addresses for
          divisions)
        </li>
        <li>MySQL information (used to store all information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After installing dependencies, you simply run
        <code>npm run dev:api</code> to start API server on port 3000 listening
        for all file changes and restarting automatically. Make sure this port
        is open and if server starts correctly, you should be able to visit
        <a href="http://localhost:3000/docs">API documentation page</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WARNING</strong>: Lately, I noticed Google Chrome started
        redirecting HTTP to HTTPS on localhost. Please make sure this is not
        your case. I fixed this problem by using different browser for
        development on HTTP port (for example Brave)
      </p>
      <h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>.vscode</code> folder - mostly search settings to ignore
          specific folders and colouring settings to easily differentiate
          multiple VS Code projects opened.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>build</code> folder - includes build of an application. Ignored
          by git, you can ignore this also. You do not have to build before
          deploying - you should build on production server (building should not
          take longer than few seconds)
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>cli</code> folder - includes scripts used in
          <code>package.json</code> commands by <code>npm</code>. You should not
          be required to touch these at all. You can find database regeneration,
          language extraction or route generation scripts here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>config</code> folder - includes basic non-private configuration
          of the API, such as pricing, URLs, tutorials or FAQ
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>locale</code> folder is automatically managed by localization
          system. You should not be required to touch these manually.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>migrations</code> folder includes MySQL migrations to re-create
          database structure on any device at any time.
          <strong>Migrations and seeds are described in details below.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>private</code> folder serves as file hosting for content
          uploaded by HR specialist (files, images, mp3, mp4, …). This folder is
          ignored by git and so can be by you
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>public</code>folder serves as a static file hosting. You can put
          any files in here and you can access it using the HTTP request. For
          example, if I want to access a file <code>test.txt</code>, I put it
          into <code>public</code> a folder and go to
          <code>http://localhost:3000/public/test.txt</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>seeds</code> folder includes MySQL configuration used after the
          migration to enter sample data into database. This is used to recreate
          the database at anytime on any device
          <strong>Migrations and seeds are described in details below.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>src</code> folder includes every single line of the API.
          <strong>Source folder is described in details below.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>swagger</code> folder is automatically managed by route
          generation system and you should only visit this folder if you need to
          edit some already existing route. Make sure to edit it in swagger,
          controller and service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>temp</code> folder is used by API to temporarily store files
          such as pre-processing MP3 before uploading to google speech to text.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="migrations-and-seeds-folders">Migrations and seeds folders</h2>
      <p>
        Using <code>knex</code> library we are managing migrations and seeds
        inside separate folders and files.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Migration defines the scheme of a table in database</li>
        <li>Seed defines sample data (rows) of a table in database</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To create new migration, you run
        <code>npm run migrate:make {NAME}</code> where <code>{NAME}</code> can
        be for example <code>interview_history_table</code>. This creates a new
        file in <code>migrations</code> folder, so you can define the scheme.
        Please refer to knex documentation or other migrations to define the
        scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create new seed, you run <code>npm run seed:make {NAME}</code> where
        <code>{NAME</code> can be for example
        <code>text_interview_hisotry</code>. This creates a new file in
        <code>seeds</code> folder, so you can define sample data for a table.
        <strong>Make sure to first define migration, then seed.</strong> Please
        refer to knex documentation or other seed definitions to learn with the
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s it. We recommend re-creating a development database each time you
        make some change. You can do this by running <code>npm run db</code>.
        <strong
          >Be aware, this deletes the database and create it from migration and
          seeds. Any data in the database will be gone.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h2 id="source-folder">Source folder</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>app.ts</code> is base file, no need to touch this one.</li>
        <li>
          <code>globals.d.ts</code> defines some global functions such as
          localization ones
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Utils.ts</code> includes utils methods used across whole
          application used multiple times, to prevent duplicating the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>api</code> folder includes the rest of the application
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>api.ts</code> includes basic definition of express server.
              Also, this loads all managers before starting the application
              (such as database or language)
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>socket</code> folder includes SocketIO manager. We use a
              socket server to refresh data on the website if two HR specialists
              from same division are on the same page and one of them does some
              changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>models</code> folder includes MySQL and Swagger type
              definitions. This is an automatically manager, and you do not need
              to edit these. Actually, you should not. It will get overwritten.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>managers</code> folder includes managers for multiple
              services to handle communication with external servers, such as
              MySQL, Google or Email server. Also, it includes some internal
              scripts to manage and store data in one place, such as Pricing or
              email Placeholders managers. Finally, it includes some Utils
              methods that are related to each other, such as Language or Log
              managers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>helpers</code> folder includes definition for guards.
              Whenever you define a new guard when defining a new route, it will
              create a new function inside this folder inside
              <code>auth.ts</code> file. Make sure to implement functionality of
              the new guard. For example, this folder includes a guard that
              prevents not logged users to do HR specialist actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>classes</code>folder includes mostly storage for categorized
              variables and methods, such as specific email placeholders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>controllers</code> folder includes basic parsing methods for
              app API routes. Each controller function gets pure http data
              (request, result) and parses it into specific variables (for
              example, username and email). These parsed data are then sent into
              service to run functionality and get response. Whenever you define
              a new route, it generated a new method inside this folder, but you
              do not need to touch it. Everything is generated automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>services</code> is a folder that includes 90% of the
              functionality of the API. Whenever you define a new route, it
              automatically prepares an empty function inside this folder for
              you. This function is strictly typed, so you know what input you
              get and what output is expected. With that said, after creating a
              new route you simply enter a specific file and at the top of the
              file, you should see a new empty method prepared for you. Simply
              implement functionality and you are done.

      <h2 id="how-to-define-new-route">How to define new route</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Start SwaggerGUI</strong>. This is a project inside hiroo
          project that servers as a visual interface for creating routes. You
          start the project, visit it’s URL and can start defining route
          visually (path, name, category, guards, parameters, output type, …)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Define route</strong>. Simply enter all information and click
          <code>copy</code> button. This will copy loooong CLI script into your
          clipboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paste CLI script</strong>. Enter <code>Server</code> folder
          and simply paste&amp;run the script. This script will check and define
          routes, write controller code, prepare service code and define the
          route in swagger documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If creating new guard, implement it</strong>. To implement a
          new guard, you simply go into <code>src/api/helpers/auth.ts</code>.
          You should find a new empty method. Simply implement guard you just
          created (such as “only allow premium users”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Write functionality of the route</strong>. Inside
          <code>src/api/services</code> there is a file for each category.
          Depending on that category name you entered in GUI, please enter a
          specific file. At the top of the class definition in this file, you
          should see a new function. This function has the same name as you
          entered in GUI and has input and output defined. Simply write
          functionality for the API route and save the file.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You are done, you can now start using a new API route. Please make sure
        to re-create the API class in frontend so you can start using it. In
        most Angular projects, you do this by running
        <code>npm run gen:api</code>. That recreated API class in frontend
        project and you can access your newly created API route by running
        <code>API.yourFunctionName()</code>. There is also a typescript
        interface for you so you can have everything typed on frontend.
