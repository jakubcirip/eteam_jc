			"text": "Since the system we offer is more or less unique, our competition is not as numerous as you would expect. Some companies try to create a fully automated hiring system that is partly similar to ours. It works on the following basis: The company chooses a position. Subsequently, it sends out the links and the AI ​​system evaluates the answers and selects the best candidates from them. However, this is not our intention. Team Hiroo fully respects the need for a person to assess and test another person well. As a result, we are in no way trying to replace human resources manager. The Hiroo platform mainly serves as a tool that helps and simplifies the work of HR and thus makes the process of collecting candidate information simple. Ultimately, this means that before inviting candidates for a job interview, HR will use all the collected information about the candidates that are in a certain place on our site to determine who to invite. We guarantee that our system works as it should and HR will choose the right people from these criteria. Don't worry that 1 out of 100 people will be chosen by this system. They will not. This will not happen as the system will select multiple candidates who have the attributes you will like. Hiroo is designed to select approximately 20-30 verified and skilled candidates from 100 registered participants.",

We realize that not all businesses in the market will be confident in using our platform. That's why we focused on industries that can make the most of our services. Our services are also adapting to these industries and will still be. One of those industries is the helpdesk. Candidates for this position are increasing and the position is about helping customers over the phone on a daily basis. It is a work that involves day-to-day work with people, and we think that one would certainly not have a problem with video-recruiting. We noticed that we live in a time of social networks, and people add incredible amounts of selfies and videos every second.

Each medal has a specific position in our system, eg. the speed of writing, the speed of response or the self-assessment of the candidate. Each such medal has three types, gold, silver, and bronze. Subsequently, the system will make a selection of candidates, based on medals, from which the human resources manager can choose. It is clear that every person can do something better and something worse, but also some of our medals may not fit in certain positions at all.  E.g. the writing speed may be irrelevant for some positions. It is the choice of HR, and the position he's finding candidates for. Therefore, we provide the ability to ignore and prioritize medals according to HR needs. This means that the ranking of candidates will adapt to the specific HR requirements of the position.",
